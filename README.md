I'm a full-stack software application developer with over 6 years of commercial programming experience, with extensive web application development and distributed software development. I've worked with some of the biggest names in gaming and YouTube, written applications ranging from gameplay plugins to multimillion dollar financial processing middlewares. I have a working knowledge of system administration, Docker and Kubernetes deployments and have written commercial applications in Kotlin, Java, Go, PHP, Python and JavaScript (Node/TypeScript).
